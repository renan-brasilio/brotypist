# BroTypist

**Predictive typing that stays on your computer.**

BroTypist suggests the next words directly beside your cursor, in the apps you already use. Accept what fits, dismiss what doesn't, and keep writing—without moving your draft into a chatbot.

## Why BroTypist?

Writing assistance should fit your workflow, not become another editor. BroTypist lives in the menu bar or system tray, runs local models, and lets you decide where it helps and what context it can see.

- **Inline, not a popup.** Grey suggestions on the same line, with word-by-word or full acceptance and configurable shortcuts.
- **Your languages.** Writing prompts support Brazilian Portuguese, English and mixed-language drafts. Suggestions still need your judgment.
- **Your model.** Choose or import local GGUF models, including Gemma and Qwen. Onboarding includes a real prediction preview.
- **Your writing style.** Optional encrypted history helps reuse your vocabulary and style locally; it does not retrain model weights.
- **Context you control.** Separate opt-ins for window text, clipboard and screenshot context, plus per-app rules and writing instructions.
- **A small resident app.** Native settings, quick pause, battery-aware inference, model unloading and publisher-signed in-app updates.

This describes the current source. Check each release's notes for its packaged features.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| macOS 15+, Apple Silicon | Primary target; native AppKit interface. |
| Linux x86-64 | Experimental test builds. Packaging, local inference and UI are tested; native typing compatibility remains limited. |
| Windows | Port and new releases are on hold. |

**Not every text field is supported.** BroTypist needs reliable focus, text, caret and insertion information. Password fields, active text composition and unsafe or unobservable targets are excluded. It stays silent rather than substituting a popup. Linux Wayland inline support is not yet ready for general use; see the [compatibility evidence](evidence/VERIFICATION.md).

## Install

### macOS

1. Download the DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/renan-brasilio/brotypist/releases). Verify it against the included `SHA256SUMS`.
2. Quit any running copy, then drag **BroTypist.app** into **Applications** and open it there.
3. Grant **Accessibility / Device Control and Data Access** and **Input Monitoring** in System Settings → Privacy & Security. Setup shows permission status.
4. Choose a model in Welcome and try the preview. Gemma 4 E2B needs about **2.84 GB** of disk space for weights; smaller options are available. Models download separately.
5. Start typing in a supported field. **Tab** accepts the next word; **Escape** dismisses the suggestion. Configure full acceptance and other shortcuts in Settings.

Current Mac packages are Apple Development signed, **not notarized**. If macOS blocks a verified download, use the app-specific **Open Anyway** action in Privacy & Security. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally. Screen Recording is needed only for optional screenshot features.

### Linux preview

Use the Debian package on Ubuntu 24.04+/Debian 13+:

```sh
sudo apt install ./BroTypist-<version>-linux-amd64.deb
brotypist
```

On Arch/CachyOS, extract the portable archive and run `./launch-brotypist` from its directory. Keep the whole bundle together and run as your desktop user, **not root**. Packaged inference requires AVX2/FMA/F16C CPU support. KDE input-method selection is explicit; installation alone does not enable Wayland typing.

Closing Settings leaves BroTypist running. **Quit BroTypist** in the resident menu closes the app and its worker. **Check for Updates…** verifies publisher-signed metadata; downloading and installing remain your choice.

## Privacy

The default GGUF backend runs locally, without an account, automatic telemetry or cloud sync. Model downloads and update checks use the network. Extra context and writing history are off by default.

Opt-in history uses encryption backed by the OS credential store, with no plaintext fallback. History and acceptance statistics have separate deletion controls. Models and user data live outside the app installation. Optional loopback-server backends are only as private as the server you configure; custom instructions are ordinary settings text, not secret storage.

## Develop

Use **Python 3.12**, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a native C/C++ toolchain:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/renan-brasilio/brotypist.git
cd brotypist
uv sync --python 3.12 --extra dev --extra local --extra build
uv run brotypist doctor
uv run brotypist --settings
uv run pytest -q
uv run python tools/build_app.py
```

Build on the target OS and architecture. Mac packaging needs full Xcode; Linux needs GI/AT-SPI and Qt dependencies. The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) records the native prerequisites. Use `INKLOW_HOME=<disposable-directory>` for manual experiments; it isolates settings/history, but not the shared model cache.

- `src/inklow/runtime.py`, `core.py`: prediction and acceptance lifecycle.
- `providers.py`, `writing.py`, `process_*.py`: inference, prompts and worker ownership.
- `appkit_*.py`, `qt_ui.py`, `native/`: interfaces and platform integration.
- `tests/`, `tools/`, `packaging/`: regressions, native smoke checks and installers.

The internal `inklow` name is retained to preserve existing data and OS permissions.

## Contribute

Found a problem? Open an issue with the app version, OS, target application and reproducible steps. Use synthetic text; never attach private drafts, profiles, keys or model weights.

Keep pull requests focused. Document public contracts and non-obvious lifecycle decisions, add behavioral regressions where needed, and report what you exercised on the actual platform. Preserve saved settings, explicit consent and safe handling of unsupported inputs. Discuss larger changes first.
