# BroTypist

Local-first predictive typing for macOS and supported Linux inputs. BroTypist lives in the menu bar/tray and offers grey same-line suggestions where the host exposes safe layout and insertion. Settings are not a writing editor. Linux development now includes the latest settings and shared prediction features; Windows builds remain held. See the explicit input/compositor limits below.

[Releases](https://github.com/renan-brasilio/brotypist/releases) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [Design specification](DESIGN.md) · [Verification](evidence/VERIFICATION.md)


## Install

This repository and its GitHub release downloads are public. The in-app updater requires no GitHub account, personal token or built-in maintainer credential.

**[BroTypist 0.4.5](https://github.com/renan-brasilio/brotypist/releases/tag/v0.4.5)** adds publisher-signed update checks, verified downloads and native restart/rollback support to the local writing-style learning core. Windows product builds remain held; historical assets are preserved.

| Platform | Download | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS, Apple Silicon | `BroTypist-0.4.5-macos-arm64.dmg` / `.zip` | Native AppKit; free-signing approval limits below |
| Windows, x86-64 | No new native installer | Port/build held; packaging definitions retained |
| Linux, x86-64 | `BroTypist-0.4.5-linux-amd64.deb` / `.tar.gz` | Portable self-updates; Debian upgrades use the system installer |

Packaged applications include Python and their UI runtime. Model weights are separate and download only when requested. Installers never include settings, writing history, credentials, or model weights.

### macOS

Use Apple Silicon with macOS 15 or newer. Drag **BroTypist.app** from the disk image to Applications; the installed app name has no version suffix. Quit the running copy before replacing it. Open **Welcome** or **Settings → Setup** to review live permission state.

The Mac distribution is **Apple Development identity-signed, not Developer ID-signed or notarized**. Historical/CI-built packages may be ad-hoc signed; read the specific release receipt. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally.

#### “Apple could not verify BroTypist” on first launch

The free distribution path is intentional: **Apple Development signing does not make this app notarized**. After checking the download against `SHA256SUMS`, dismiss the warning with **Done**, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, find the blocked BroTypist entry and choose **Open Anyway**, then confirm **Open**. This is an app-specific decision; do not choose Move to Trash if you intend to keep it.

Apple may require approval again for a replacement build. OTA publisher signatures authenticate our packages but do not replace Apple's notarization or your permission to launch them. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally or remove quarantine attributes. A Developer ID/notarized distribution would require a separately approved paid Apple Developer setup; it is not claimed here.

### Windows — held

The MSI installs per user and adds a **BroTypist** Start Menu shortcut. Extract the complete portable ZIP before running `BroTypist.exe`; use `BroTypist-cli.exe` for terminal commands. The EXEs are **not standalone**: keep `_internal` and the rest of the payload together.

Windows 10/11 and an AVX2, FMA, and F16C-capable x86-64 CPU are required for the portable inference build. Releases are unsigned unless explicitly stated otherwise. Do not bypass Windows security protections globally.

### Linux

Install the specific Debian package you built or downloaded with `sudo apt install ./<package>.deb`, then run **`brotypist` as your desktop user, not with sudo**. The current package replaces the old `inklow` package while leaving external user data alone. Portable builds run through `launch-brotypist`; keep their directory intact.

Native Debian releases target Ubuntu 24.04+/Debian 13+ amd64, with D-Bus and an AVX2/FMA/F16C-capable CPU. **CachyOS/Arch and other distributions use the portable archive, not the Debian package:** extract the whole directory and run `./launch-brotypist` as your desktop user. Keep the complete payload together. Other architectures and CPU baselines require a target-system build.

#### KDE Wayland

BroTypist uses KWin's explicitly selected **input-method-v1** connection for keyboard forwarding and text insertion. The development renderer uses a separate transparent, mouse-through layer for grey same-line text—not preedit, a suggestion card, raw input devices or a screen-reader identity. It requires layer-shell, fractional-scale, viewport, output, window-metadata and presentation-feedback protocols. A compositor lacking any required primitive remains manual-only; installer/model-preview success does not prove typing support.

X11 is also capability-bound: ordinary overlays require explicit inactive-composition state, native font/direction attributes and matching visible glyph metrics. Many providers omit these; those inputs remain silent. A passing installer or local-model preview is not proof that an arbitrary Linux input supports inline completion.

```sh
# From a complete portable application directory:
./launch-brotypist wayland install
# For a Debian-managed installation:
brotypist wayland install
```

The install command only creates or refreshes BroTypist's per-user selector entry, bound to its actual frozen executable. Explicitly choose **BroTypist** in **KDE System Settings → Keyboard → Virtual Keyboard**; Welcome and Setup can open that selector. KDE supplies the private socket and owns the resulting launch. Do not invoke `--wayland-input-method` directly from a terminal. After moving a portable directory, run the install command from its new location again.

Selecting an input method lets it receive keyboard events and surrounding text for supported fields and occupies KDE's input-method slot. Consider an existing Fcitx/IBus setup before replacing it. BroTypist never selects itself or changes the desktop session automatically. After quitting a selected instance, choose **None**, then **BroTypist**, to start it again. A terminal `brotypist doctor` cannot inspect the KDE-owned private connection; use the running app's Setup status.

The exercised Qt target uses **text-input-v3**. A target can request it at its own launch with `QT_WAYLAND_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL=zwp_text_input_v3 QT_IM_MODULE=wayland <application>`. The tested default text-input-v2 path lacked complete context. Do not set those variables globally just to make one application work.

Same-line rendering additionally requires a unique active window/PID, matching client/frame geometry, trustworthy font/glyph/clip metrics and positively inactive composition. Ambiguous server-decoration offsets are not guessed. Geometry, scale, focus, selection or composition changes revoke the displayed frame; only the exact compositor-acknowledged visible prefix may be accepted. Unsupported inputs stay silent and do not consume ordinary acceptance keys. Background window context, atomic cross-app replacement, selected-text synonyms and emoji/emoticon rewriting remain unavailable on this Wayland path. Historical native-panel receipts are not same-line proof; consult the current verification record for exercised targets.

KDE window-metadata access is declared through `X-KDE-Wayland-Interfaces=org_kde_plasma_window_management` for BroTypist's own executable. The renderer reads geometry, PID and state; delivered titles/app icons are ignored. The application requests no fake-input or screen-capture protocol and never disables KDE permission checks. Source registration is deliberately refused because granting a shared Python interpreter would authorize unrelated scripts; build the frozen app first. The disposable developer fixture instead uses separate private executable identities and a private compositor, without registering anything on your normal desktop.

### Verify downloads

Releases include `SHA256SUMS`. On Linux, use `sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`; on macOS, use `shasum -a 256 <file>`; on Windows, use `Get-FileHash <file> -Algorithm SHA256`. Compare against the matching manifest entry. Integrity checks are not a signing or notarization certificate.

### In-app updates

Use **Check for Updates…** in the resident menu or the updates section of **About**. Automatic checks are configurable and run at most once per day; they send no writing, model, history or machine identifier. Downloads and **Install & Relaunch** require your action and do not interrupt typing automatically.

The app verifies an Ed25519-signed manifest using its pinned publisher public key, then checks the selected package's size/hash and native application identity. An independent bundled helper waits for clean shutdown and actual process exit before atomic replacement. A new native GUI must acknowledge startup; failed installation/startup restores the complete previous build. Settings, history, cached models and desktop/startup preferences remain outside the replaced app.

Writable Mac bundles and user-owned Linux portable installations can self-update. Debian-managed installations download the verified `.deb` and hand it to the system package installer for administrator approval and restart; the app never silently replaces `/opt/brotypist` or elevates itself. Source checkouts, disk-image/read-only locations and held platforms cannot self-replace. Move a Mac app out of its DMG before updating.

On macOS, the helper checks code-signature-sealed bundle versions without executing an unapproved staged app. The actual replacement launches through LaunchServices and must acknowledge its first native GUI event-loop iteration. If macOS blocks that launch or startup is not confirmed within a minute, the helper restores the previous build; approve the app-specific OS prompt when available, or install the verified DMG manually. Free signing does not promise unattended updates.

Versions through 0.4.3 have no updater: **one manual installation of an OTA-capable version is required first**. Free Mac builds retain the per-app launch approval requirement above.

## First run and daily use

Welcome covers privacy, system access, explicit model selection, a real local prediction preview and the resident menu. Reopen it from **About → Show Welcome**. The development versions on macOS and Linux share twelve focused settings sections:

These settings are newer than published **0.4.5**. The release table above describes published assets, not an assertion that the current development checkout has been released. Platform-specific controls are shown only where supported.

- **Setup:** live required/optional permission and model-readiness states.
- **General:** startup, accessory icon, master/default prediction switches, completion length, inside-text behavior and typo controls.
- **AI Models:** recommended and installed catalogue models, explicit download/import, progress and cancellation. Backend, acceleration and prompt settings are under Advanced.
- **Context:** separate opt-ins for focused-window Accessibility text, clipboard, screenshot OCR and screenshot-based appearance.
- **Personalization:** encrypted history, local style/vocabulary evidence, recording controls, custom instructions and scoped deletion/counts.
- **Emoji / Shortcuts:** emoji preferences, configurable physical keys, word/full acceptance, punctuation and Escape behavior.
- **Battery:** live percentage and distinct charging/external-power states, on-demand behavior, installed smaller-model selection and shorter completions.
- **App Settings:** searchable app/domain rules, accessible icon actions with tooltips, compatibility controls, Tab/recording overrides and instructions.
- **Labs:** explicit alternatives and selected-text synonyms. These numbered tools are separate from ordinary inline suggestions.
- **Statistics / About:** actual accepted-writing aggregates, source/release links, Welcome and Quit. About shows one state-based software-update action rather than separate competing buttons.

New installations select **Gemma 4 E2B**, a pinned 2.84 GB public GGUF, with a conservative RAM recommendation. **Gemma 3 1B** is an independently sourced 806 MB option requiring explicit acceptance of [Gemma Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms). The catalogue also contains larger Gemma 3/4 and Qwen 3 variants with memory guards; catalogue metadata is not a claim that every size has been exercised on this Mac. Qwen2.5 1.5B and the English Tiny preset remain available. Existing saved model choices are not silently replaced. Suggestions are not a grammar or factuality guarantee.

Onboarding selects, downloads or imports a model without opening Settings. Choosing a missing model blocks Continue even if another model is ready; choosing a cached catalogue model activates it without another download. Local file and inference-library readiness are checked before continuing; the next Try it step exercises actual inference. Settings resize without discarding unsaved instruction text, editor selection or scroll position.

Automatic completion is eligible after one non-whitespace character by default, following the 150 ms typing pause and normal field-safety checks. Existing saved thresholds are preserved: if an older profile waits for eight characters, change **Minimum preceding characters** on macOS or **General → Minimum typed characters** on Linux to `1`. Eligibility is not a guarantee of a useful model result; cold loading can still take seconds. Superseded optional-context waits are cancelled without reducing the current draft’s fresh-context budget.

Writing prompts follow the clause at the cursor rather than forcing the dominant language of the whole message. Brazilian Portuguese and English can coexist without translating existing text or introducing gratuitous slang. The original typed ending remains exact, untrusted task data while token healing restores its native token boundary. Explicit language preferences are model guidance, not a guaranteed language switch; short ambiguous prefixes can remain uncertain, and a model can return no useful suggestion.

The resident menu stays compact: **Enable predictions**, a **Pause** submenu, the current app's prediction switch, **Settings…**, **Check for Updates…** and **Quit BroTypist**. Model details, diagnostics, recording controls, statistics and battery information live in Settings instead of menu cards. Global and current-app checkmarks describe their saved preferences; Resume clears the timed pause without changing the global switch.

The Battery pane and resident-icon tooltip show verified power readings sampled off the UI thread at most once per 15 seconds. A brief charging cue animates the resident icon and visible Settings power card; Reduce Motion or increased contrast keeps the charging indicator static. Reduced pane-arrival fades remain short, and hiding the surface, locking/switching sessions or quitting stops motion. At a known discharging level of **20% or below**, BroTypist asks for charging help once per discharge cycle in a nonactivating menu-bar-anchored hint; dismissing it or battery-level fluctuations do not repeat it. Reconnecting to verified external power rearms the next cycle. Unknown/no-battery readings never invent a percentage or a low-battery request.

Linux samples power/session state outside the Qt event loop. Motion is conservative: unsupported desktop motion/contrast preferences use a static charging indicator. The low-battery hint additionally requires a verified unlocked active session and a real tray anchor; an unavailable tray or unknown session never produces a floating, unanchored prompt.

| Action | Existing default |
| --- | --- |
| Accept next word | Tab |
| Accept full suggestion | Physical key above Tab |
| Request a suggestion | Control + physical key above Tab |
| Dismiss and briefly pause | Escape |
| Open field controls | Click the small caret icon above/beside the field |
| Stop the app and worker | **Quit BroTypist** in the menu-bar/tray menu |

Closing Settings keeps BroTypist running when a tray is available. Without a tray, closing offers a real Quit; Settings and Welcome also have a persistent **Quit BroTypist** button. Quit works independently of exported tray-menu tracking and does not change KDE's selected input method. Normal keys pass through when no eligible suggestion is active. Saved shortcuts, models and recording preferences are preserved.

With the default nonzero idle timeout, a cached local GGUF model prepares when an authorized multiline writing field is focused, before the typing threshold/debounce needs a prediction. This includes an empty, writable native field with verified window ownership and valid field bounds: it has no glyph run to measure yet, but preparation sends configuration only, not a draft. Drawing and acceptance still require independently verified same-line layout. Protected/unsupported fields and battery force-only mode do not trigger focused preparation. Loading still costs seconds; this is not a guarantee that every first keystroke receives an immediate prediction.

Preparation evaluates only fixed, trusted policy text to warm native kernels and reuse its KV prefix. It never sends a draft, references, custom instructions or learned writing to the preparation command, and produces no suggestions. First post-ready provider samples improved; loading itself still costs seconds.

Models use a separate process and unload after five minutes idle by default. To trade higher steady memory use for faster first-word responses, set **Battery → Inference Memory → Release model after idle (seconds)** to `0`: the selected cached GGUF prepares at startup without needing an input field and remains loaded during inactivity. Global disable, pause, model replacement, privacy revocation and Quit still release model state; after reactivation, the resident policy prepares fresh state. Battery on-demand mode suppresses proactive preparation. Failed startup preparation is not retried on every GUI tick; an explicit configuration/activation change can retry. Nothing downloads automatically.

Preparation moves loading ahead of typing; it does not remove loading cost or guarantee model quality. Nonzero saved idle timeouts are preserved. Temporary field-scoped Escape suppression keeps the worker warm. The typing-delay default is 150 ms; saved values are preserved. UI-thread readiness notifications deliver prepared requests and streamed results without waiting for the fallback polling timer. Welcome's private preview does not record text and closes its worker on focus loss/close. Separately managed loopback servers have their own lifetimes.

### OS access and suggestion placement

- **macOS:** grant **Accessibility / Device Control and Data Access** and **Input Monitoring** to the installed app in System Settings → Privacy & Security. Source Python/terminal permission is not proof of installed-app permission. Focused-window context uses Accessibility text and does not require Screen Recording. An ad-hoc signature replacement may require manual approval again.
- **Windows:** target controls must expose supported UI Automation/native Edit behavior. Elevated apps can require matching integrity privileges; BroTypist does not bypass isolation.
- **Linux:** run in your user's D-Bus/accessibility session. X11 uses AT-SPI; KDE Wayland additionally needs explicit input-method selection. Some Qt targets need `QT_LINUX_ACCESSIBILITY_ALWAYS_ON=1` before starting.

Ordinary completions are transparent, mouse-through grey text at the host caret: no card, border, shadow or keycap. Secure, excluded, hidden, selected, composing, clipped or unobservable inputs stay silent and do not intercept acceptance keys. AX typography is checked against observed glyph advances when exposed. At a document end, providers such as Qt/Telegram that omit zero-length caret bounds can use the final observed LTR glyph edge. When they omit font attributes, BroTypist fits a system font to the observed row; that is not an exact host-font match, does not repaint existing words, and needs no screenshot consent. Soft-wrapped paragraphs are measured on the caret's visual row. Opt-in screenshot appearance can recover additional styling evidence; inside-text displacement still requires measured foreground/background colors and a fully visible same-line suffix. Unsupported RTL/custom-layout/provider cases remain silent, not a mirror/popup fallback. Stock VS Code chat fields have a narrowly scoped accessible-name exception; ordinary code fields remain off unless explicitly enabled. Other editor composers and terminal/browser compatibility require their own native evidence, not a generic “AI” label. A working Welcome preview is not a universal compatibility claim.

**Bounded compatibility:** Google Docs needs both screen-reader and braille support in **Tools → Accessibility**. The metadata-only setup offer is not proof that document typing works. Aside Browser's native preference actions failed persisted-state verification; BroTypist does not change Docs preferences through that provider and shows manual instructions instead. Terminal completion is an additional explicit opt-in with separate per-host Automation consent. Its current input adapter recognizes only the source-verified standalone Codex 0.162.1 single-line composer in Terminal.app; iTerm, other agents, multiplexers, shells, wrapped drafts and hidden paste/image elements remain unavailable. Terminal consent never authorizes scrollback as window context.

When focused-window context is enabled, a prediction refreshes its authorized reference text rather than treating unchanged window geometry as unchanged content. The background request waits up to 250 ms for that read. If it is too slow, the previous reference is not reused; optional context may be absent for that prediction. Local model output still needs review for grammar and factual accuracy.

### Learn your writing locally

1. Open **Personalization**.
2. Enable local learning after reviewing the consent dialog. OS-backed encrypted storage must be available; there is no plaintext fallback.
3. To learn from sessions where you accept nothing, explicitly enable **Also learn when no suggestion is accepted**. Existing app/site recording overrides still take precedence.

This is bounded local evidence, **not model-weight training**. Newly observed small edits supply sentence-length, punctuation, contraction/casing and recurring-vocabulary statistics. Existing drafts, bulk replacements, legacy records and BroTypist's own generated edits do not establish authorship. Small observed changes are conservative evidence, not proof of every physical keystroke or third-party autocorrection.

Learning uses the same app for domainless fields, or the same exact website host, and confidently matched English, Portuguese, Spanish, French or German. Unknown/ambiguous language abstains; prediction language support still depends on the chosen model. Current draft language, grammar and explicit instructions outrank inferred style. Learned evidence is untrusted task data, not commands or facts.

History is off by default and is not silently enabled during upgrades. Strength **Off** excludes learned evidence. App/site exclusions take effect on the next request. Locking or deleting history clears derived state; deletion also cancels pending suggestions and releases model context so the old profile is not reused.

## Privacy and data preservation

- No built-in cloud inference, account requirement, automatic telemetry or cloud sync. Alternative inference endpoints are restricted to literal loopback addresses; their operators control their logging/network behavior.
- Clipboard, focused-window Accessibility context and both screenshot options are off by default. AX context reads bounded visible reference text from the verified focused window/document, excluding protected/hidden content and unrelated editable fields. Screenshot OCR is AX-first; appearance capture takes the focused window and crops around the line in memory. Both require explicit opt-in and macOS Screen Recording permission. Images are never saved/uploaded by the product; OCR text is short-lived and cleared on revocation. Reads recheck consent, exact window/field/domain, security and policy before capture and publication. OS recording indicators can appear.
- Writing history is opt-in, AES-GCM encrypted and requires the OS credential store, with no plaintext fallback. Aggregate statistics contain acceptance counts, not writing. History and statistics have separate deletion controls.
- Custom instructions are ordinary settings text, not a place to store credentials.
- Models, preferences and history live outside the installation and are not uninstalled with it.

**Stable internal identities are intentional.** The Python package `inklow`, bundle/desktop ID `com.inklow.Inklow`, existing startup/credential keys and `inklow` data/cache directories remain established technical namespaces. Changing the visible app/repository name does not migrate encrypted data or deliberately reset OS permission identity. Public commands and new installer/bundle names are BroTypist / `brotypist`.

`INKLOW_HOME` remains the isolated settings/data profile switch for development. It does not relocate the shared model cache. Isolated profiles cannot change startup or desktop integration. OS swap/crash collection and independently managed servers have privacy behavior outside the app's control.

## Develop

Use Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Build on the intended OS and architecture; a Mac build cannot produce a Windows runtime.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:renan-brasilio/brotypist.git
cd brotypist
uv sync --python 3.12 --extra dev --extra local --extra build
uv run brotypist doctor
uv run brotypist --settings
uv run brotypist --pane welcome
uv run pytest -q
```

GGUF builds need Xcode Command Line Tools, Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, or GCC/Clang/CMake. Linux additionally needs distribution AT-SPI/GI and desktop libraries; use its Python with system bindings when appropriate:

```sh
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev,local,build]'
```

`brotypist model list` reports the pinned catalogue and licenses. `brotypist model download --preset gemma4-e2b --no-select` downloads without changing selection. Gemma 3 additionally requires `--accept-model-license` or explicit agreement in the native UI. Use `INKLOW_HOME=<disposable-directory>` for the entire smoke sequence instead of changing your normal profile. It isolates settings/data, not the shared model cache.

### Synthetic model checks

Use an existing model; the evaluator does not download weights or change your normal app profile:

```sh
uv run python tools/benchmark_writing.py \
  --model /absolute/path/model.gguf \
  --output /tmp/brotypist-writing.json \
  --repetitions 2 --max-tokens 32 --completion-length medium
```

The authored corpus covers multilingual writing, reference facts, Unicode partial words, fixed suffixes, alternatives and synonyms. Reports include actual native call settings, raw/assembled output, cancellation and close observations. Mechanical pass counts and literal fact checks are **not grammar/semantic accuracy**: inspect the per-dimension unreviewed labels and the actual continuations. Match repeated samples by case ID, not list position—the evaluator rotates case order. Provider token-stream times exclude desktop focus/capture/debounce/rendering; installed-app permission, same-line pixels and real acceptance need their own unlocked native smoke.


### Build applications, icons and installers

```sh
uv run python tools/build_app.py
uv run python tools/smoke_bundle.py
# Run the matching native packager from a committed build:
VERSION=$(uv run python -c 'from inklow import __version__; print(__version__)')
uv run python tools/package_macos.py --bundle dist/BroTypist.app --output release --version "$VERSION"
# On native Linux:
uv run python tools/package_linux.py --bundle dist/BroTypist --output release --version "$VERSION"
```

The inference smoke needs an explicitly configured existing model. Installers consume complete native builds; they do not download models or cross-compile. Windows packaging needs .NET SDK 8 and WiX **5.0.2** (`dotnet tool install --global wix --version 5.0.2`). Linux needs `dpkg-dev`, GI/AT-SPI/GTK and Qt libraries; the Wayland client additionally needs a C compiler, `pkg-config`, Wayland/xkbcommon development libraries, protocol XMLs and `wayland-scanner`. Use CPython 3.12 on Ubuntu 24.04 for its distro GI ABI. The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) lists exact build prerequisites.

Canonical artwork is in `design/icons/`. The normal, dark, tinted and small SVGs preserve the supplied Ghost Caret geometry. `uv run python tools/generate_icons.py` rebuilds classic PNG/ICO/ICNS assets; the small artwork remains the classic and in-app compact variant.

Mac bundles additionally require **full Xcode with `actool` and Icon Composer support**, not Command Line Tools alone. The build compiles `BroTypist.icon` to a real root-level `Assets.car` before signing, with system light/dark/tinted variants. Regenerate its editable layered sources with `uv run python tools/generate_icons.py --composer-only`. Current compiler verification uses Xcode 27.1; runtime apps need no authoring tools.

macOS 26+ chooses and scales the native full-artwork icon. Icon Composer does not select different geometry for small Dock/Finder sizes, and macOS can apply its own enclosure treatment even with authored effects disabled. The classic fallback remains packaged; its appearance has not been runtime-verified on macOS 15.

For stable local Mac permission identity, sign with the **same existing Keychain identity**:

```sh
INKLOW_CODESIGN_IDENTITY='<existing identity name or fingerprint>' uv run python tools/build_app.py
```

Never export or commit signing keys. Reusing an identity is not a notarization claim.

### Release workflow

The [macOS and Linux checks workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs deterministic regressions, native settings, source/frozen inference and platform installer checks. Linux installation checks use a private D-Bus/X11 session and invoke the visible own-process Quit button; they do not establish universal desktop typing or Wayland inline support. Windows jobs and automatic release publication remain held.

Update `pyproject.toml`, `src/inklow/__init__.py` and `uv.lock`, then commit before a release build. **Actions → macOS and Linux checks** accepts a matching `release_tag=v<version>` to validate/build native artifacts; it does not publish automatically. Never overwrite published versions or historical assets.

Manual publication uses native packagers, smoke receipts and `tools/release_assets.py`. `manifest` seals each verified native package set. `prepare --inputs <directory> --output <new-directory> --tag v<version> --commit <source-sha> --repo renan-brasilio/brotypist --targets macos-arm64 linux-x86_64` works offline: it verifies the requested targets and their receipts, signs `update-manifest.json`, and produces the packages, `release-manifest.json`, `update-manifest.sig` and `SHA256SUMS`. `publish` performs the same verification before draft-first GitHub publication.

Publisher signing requires the Ed25519 private key provisioned in macOS Keychain under service **BroTypist Release Signing**, account **ed25519-v1**. The corresponding public key is pinned in `src/inklow/update_keys.py`; a mismatched signing key is rejected. This key authenticates the update feed and package hashes; it does not replace Apple's code signature or notarization. Never export it, commit it or put credentials in the public feed. Disclose held platforms and compatibility limits; do not publish unverified installers or label source-only changes as installed.

Publishing through `gh` requires a GitHub API credential with repository **Contents: write** access; SSH push authorization does not grant Release API access. The 0.4.0 release used the existing authenticated owner browser after the CLI token refused writes. No token, SSH credential or account permission was changed.

### Source layout

- `src/inklow/runtime.py`, `core.py`: controller, exact snapshots, acceptance guards.
- `process_client.py`, `process_worker.py`, `providers.py`, `writing.py`, `models.py`: isolated local inference, prompts, verified downloads.
- `appkit_ui.py`, `appkit_welcome.py`, `appkit_power.py`, `qt_ui.py`, `appkit_overlay.py`: resident native/portable interfaces.
- `preview.py`: owned-field ephemeral Welcome inference; no global capture or persistent history.
- `native/`, `system.py`, `power.py`: OS integration, shared power sampling/discharge policy, supported accessibility/text-input paths and explicit OS actions.
- `config.py`, `storage.py`: preferences, encryption and statistics.
- `tools/`, `packaging/`, `.github/workflows/`: verification, native packaging and releases.

The app uses native AppKit on macOS and an isolated llama.cpp worker. No fake MLX/Sparkle controls, invented throughput/RAM counters, Cotypist account impersonation or automatic telemetry. iCloud synchronization is explicitly deferred. Framework/compiler tools used for REA are analysis dependencies, not application runtime requirements.

## Research and attribution

[Implementation verification](evidence/VERIFICATION.md) · [Reference-app research](evidence/COTYPIST.md)

BroTypist contains no Cotypist proprietary code, models or artwork. Unicode emoji data, third-party runtimes and model weights retain their own licenses. No model weights are committed or embedded in installers.
