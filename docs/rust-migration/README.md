# BroTypist: feature-preserving Rust conversion

Status: **implementation and native integration in progress; native Rust UI, Rust 1.99.1/Cargo, a dedicated `migration/rust-native` branch, draft PR and native CI artifacts approved on 2026-10-30**. The user subsequently authorized local macOS installation; its backed-up signed candidate is recorded below. No main merge or release publication is authorized.
Baseline: `6eaeed5fe56e1ea8dcf878b1b7498f922c26fd59`, version 0.4.13.

Requested outcome: convert the application to Rust for macOS, Windows and Linux while retaining all existing functionality. macOS remains the first parity gate; implemented Windows/Linux paths must also be migrated. This is not authorization to ship reduced-functionality builds, add cloud features or publish releases. Local macOS replacement was separately requested and completed with a rollback copy.

Read only the section/artifact needed:

- [Review and observed baseline](review.md): current findings, baseline tests/runtime checks, known CI failures.
- [Feature acceptance register](parity.md): P01-P32, platform limitations and exact data/identity contracts.
- This file: proposed boundaries, dependency-ordered packages, bounded subagent protocol and release gates.

## 1. Decision and non-negotiables

**Approved architecture:** shared Rust behavior/services; OS-native adapters and interfaces. macOS uses Rust Objective-C bindings to AppKit/AX/CoreText/Quartz/Security/Vision; Windows uses UIA/Win32; Linux uses GTK 3.24, AT-SPI/Pango/X11/KWin behind explicit capability contracts. Linux GTK/Pango/Cairo Rust bindings are unified at 0.18 to avoid duplicate native `links` dependencies. No Tauri/webview or Swift shell.

This removes Python from the **final shipped application**, not every non-Rust dependency: llama.cpp remains C/C++, and OS frameworks/toolkits remain native dependencies. Replacing it with Candle/MLX or translating every upstream C/C++ dependency is not required and would add model-compatibility risk.

The user selected Rust-owned native UI over the presented Swift-shell and webview-settings alternatives. The candidate checkout now selects Rust exclusively: obsolete Python runtime, tests, packaging launchers, build/evaluation scripts and dependency manifests were removed after the Rust candidate ran. The complete unchanged Python baseline remains in an external detached worktree and Git history for remaining comparisons, never a shipped fallback. Language-neutral corpus/assets and historical evidence are preserved. This branch source cutover is not production rollout or closure of the remaining native gates. Rust 1.99.1 is installed and pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Performance is measured, not assumed from language: avoid tick-by-tick full-draft copies, repeated scalar indexing, synchronous keychain/AX/model/power work in hooks, or a universal mutex across OS/UI/inference. Reuse immutable text buffers and checked offset maps when text changes; bound caches and queues according to actual lifecycle safety. Do not drop user input to satisfy a memory limit during an issued uncertain mutation.

## 2. Workspace ownership and interfaces

Production uses the `crates/brotypist` application crate with the logical module boundaries below, an independently linked `crates/brotypist-updater` helper, and Rust `xtask` distribution tooling. Do not create empty boundary crates.

| Owner | Boundary | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `core`, `features`, `spelling`, `runtime` | Exact scalar-indexed observations, policy/rules, suggestion/choice/spelling decisions, presentation/input leases, scheduling transitions with injected logical time. | OS handles in pure decisions; duplicate prediction lifecycle. |
| `config`, `paths`, `storage`, `models`, `updates` | Compatible preferences, encrypted SQLite/keychain history, statistics/learning, model acquisition, signed feed/download. | Native edit authority. |
| `inference_native`, `providers`, `writing`, `worker`, `process_client` | Prompts/token budgets/healing/output fences, three providers, pinned llama.cpp ownership and process supervision. | Foreground reads, OS hooks or profile mutation. |
| `platform`, `system`, `power`, `instance` | Per-OS capture/edit/input/context/permissions, special Mac adapters, system services and lifecycle ownership. | Cross-platform policy duplication or inferred acceptance from dispatch. |
| `cli`, `ui`, `preview` | Native main loop, all controls, resident lifecycle, visible presentation acknowledgments and ephemeral preview. | Model evaluation on the UI thread. |
| `brotypist-updater` | Independently linked offline binary using the same canonical trust/transaction source without the app/llama dependency. | Capturing typing, loading models or owning user data. |

The integration owner controls shared manifests/lockfile, interfaces, release identity and CI. A dedicated inference owner controls `build.rs`; packaging consumes its fresh native-library manifest, not guessed target-cache files. Agents submit dependency requirements rather than competing lockfile edits. Each owner implements its nonoverlapping production files and meaningful behavioral tests together.

Freeze these cross-slice contracts before dependent packages start:

- **Text indices:** separate `ScalarIndex`, `Utf16Offset`, `Utf8Offset`; checked conversions and rejection of surrogate/interior/out-of-bounds ranges. Preserve original text; normalization/casefold only for derived matching. One cached offset map per immutable text revision avoids repeated rescans.
- **Snapshot versus authority:** text/policy identity is distinct from window/document identity, permission epoch, native-input revision and layout generation. Ordinary geometry refresh can reposition; authority change invalidates context, output, display and edit claims.
- **Capabilities:** append, existing-selection replacement, arbitrary atomic replacement, safe inline geometry, explicit chooser anchor, native manual controls; never infer one from another. Unknown permission/composition/security state is not “allowed.”
- **Decision/event boundary:** observe field, command, prepared context, model chunk/final, spelling verdict, presentation acknowledgment, native edit outcome, configuration/power change. Effects request work/render/edit/record; the decision core does not execute native effects.
- **Presentation:** acknowledgment contains authority/revision, exactly visible completion prefix or complete choice rows and visibility generation. Hiding/reordering invalidates acknowledgment. Ordinary suggestion is grey same-line text or absent, never a popup substitute.
- **Edit outcome:** distinguish rejected-with-no-mutation, dispatched-awaiting-observation, applied-with-verified-result and indeterminate/possibly-mutated. Record acceptance/history against verified outcomes, not input queue delivery. Never retry uncertain edits automatically; keep replay ownership until the native transaction resolves.
- **Inference:** configuration-only prepare; cumulative text replaces prior stream text, not append-deltas; immutable request ID/generation/authority, bounded messages, proceed barrier, cancellation epoch and explicit release watermark. One native context owner, outside UI/hook threads.
- **Privacy revocation:** cancel prepared/in-flight work, release model context as required, clear references/OCR/derived learning/display leases, and prevent stale events from reauthorizing reads or writes.
- **Persistence:** exact formats/paths/credential identity in parity.md. Never point an unfinished candidate at the normal profile. Synthetic crypto compatibility uses injected disposable keys, not production key reads.
- **UI actions:** captured app/domain and displayed updater intent survive deferred execution. Dirty editors and three-way settings rebasing are functional contracts, not styling details.

Candidate binding research: [objc2](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2) supports main-thread markers and retained native delegates; [llama-cpp-rs](https://github.com/utilityai/llama-cpp-rs) exposes explicit decode/sampler/token/KV APIs. Neither proves BroTypist parity. Initially pin llama.cpp to the native revision used by `llama-cpp-python==0.3.36`: `0c1e57098bba43ac29e6e3b677cdceebdd22334f`. Verify upstream pin, wrapper defaults/sampler order and actual Gemma4 load before adopting a Rust binding revision. If a binding cannot target it safely, use a small audited C ABI wrapper, not an unverified inference-engine substitution. Pin reviewed versions/licenses for all dependencies in Cargo.lock.

## 3. Implementation waves

These are complete, testable packages, not permission to stop at a scaffold. A package is integrated only after its focused behavior works. The old app remains the reference until every required parity row has evidence; missing gates remain open rather than being redefined as out of scope.

| Wave / packet | Owned implementation | Dependencies | Required parity / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0A: baseline contracts | Synthetic canonical settings/history/Unicode/worker/event fixtures and explicit source provenance; no personal writing or production keys. | Frontend strategy and toolchain available. | P01-P32 inventory, baseline CI issue disposition. Capture intended semantics, not incidental wording/defaults or known bugs. |
| 0B: runnable vertical probe | Disposable Rust CLI + actual pinned Tiny and cached Gemma4 generation; native owned Mac text field + ghost panel + explicit acceptance readback. | 0A text/authority interfaces. | Prove binding/model compatibility, native ownership, same-line rendering and event-loop integration before broad port. This is a disposable feasibility probe, not the deliverable. |
| 1A: core/features/spelling policy | `brotypist-core` observations/indices/acceptance/features/chords and pure spelling planning. | 0A; shared contract frozen. | P01, P04-P06; adversarial Unicode and decoded choice safety R3/R11. |
| 1B: config/data services | Paths/settings/rules/SQLite/AES-GCM/keychain adapters/statistics/learning. | 0A persistence fixtures. | P07-P09, P28; bidirectional ciphertext/profile compatibility and corruption/lost-key refusal. |
| 1C: models/providers | Catalogue/acquisition plus prompt/token/healing/stream engine and GGUF/HTTP providers. | 0B native model feasibility; shared generation types. | P13-P16; all existing families/quantizations accounted for, actual cached models; R2/R3/R11. |
| 1D: update services | Signed feed, download, state machine and independent transaction data model. | 0A trust/identity fixtures. | P29; tamper/redirect/size/hash/cancel/daily policy. No live release mutation. |
| 2A: controller + worker | Owned scheduling/effect integration, supervisor/process ABI, preparation/cancel/release, spelling and presentation leases, history commitment. | 1A-1C. | P02-P03, P11-P12, P17; deterministic races and actual child pipes/exit; R5-R8. |
| 2B: Mac observation/geometry | AX/framework ownership, browser/document identity, ranges/typography/CoreText and native overlay primitives. | 1A authority/capability contracts. | P19-P20; Secure Input unknown refusal R1; no protected reads; actual owned controls. |
| 2C: Mac mutation/special adapters | Input gate/hooks/replay, native edits, terminal, Docs help, language/spelling, ScreenCaptureKit/Vision and consent. | 2B stable capture contract; 1A. | P05-P06, P10, P21-P22; honest mutation outcomes, fixed diagnostics R13; special unsupported cases retained. |
| 3A: Mac product shell | Complete native settings/menu/onboarding/preview/power/startup/URL/CLI integration. | 1B, 1D, 2A-2C. | P11-P12, P18, P26, P28, P31; actual pane/control/draft/accessibility/focus/close/Quit flows. |
| 3B: Windows native owner | Native capacity/credential/power/startup, UIA capture/edit/geometry, hook lifecycle and complete chosen settings/resident/preview UI. | 1A-1D, 2A. | P06-P18, P23, P27-P28, P31; native Windows CI and owned host fields, R2/R8/R9. |
| 3C: Linux X11/product owner | AT-SPI/Pango/X11, credentials/power/startup, complete chosen settings/tray/no-tray/preview UI. | 1A-1D, 2A. | P06-P18, P24, P27-P28, P31; real session and insertion-only limitations. |
| 3D: KDE transport owner | Private socket/bootstrap, input-method protocol/XKB/SHM/manual surfaces; C ABI retained only until complete Rust equivalent is verified. | 3C toolkit-init contract and 1A. | P25; real KWin manual controls/refusal/input forwarding/cleanup; obsolete harness R10 replaced. Do not enable ordinary inline. |
| 4A: updater + Mac distribution | Offline Rust updater, signed native bundle, Icon Composer, DMG/ZIP, startup ACK/rollback and developer promotion safety. | All Mac behavior plus 1D. | P28-P30; actual healthy/failed/delayed startup transaction, quarantine/identity/data preservation; R4 and delayed-child investigation. Fix icon toolchain prerequisite without changing OS safety policy. |
| 4B: Windows/Linux distribution | MSI/ZIP, DEB/portable, desktop/input-method ownership, uninstall/data preservation and platform update/held semantics. | 3B-3D and updater contract. | P28-P30; native install/upgrade/rollback/remove evidence. No publication until authorized. |
| 5: full parity and clean cutover | Complete three-OS behavioral/host/installer matrix, remove obsolete runtime/callers/dependencies/build paths, update canonical docs/release tooling. | All prior packets. | P01-P32; no Python runtime/shipped shim, no dropped setting/control/provider, no false platform-support claim; one candidate replaces one old runtime only after proof. |

Parallelism follows true dependencies: wave 1 packages can run together; Windows/Linux owners need not wait for Mac UI completion once shared interfaces are stable. Narrow Mac mutation work waits for AX identity/ownership, not for unrelated storage. Large UI packages are subdivided by complete pane groups only after the chosen frontend supplies real shared controls/navigation; no duplicate UI state models.

## 4. Low-context subagent execution protocol

Use one integration owner and normally four to six active substantial owners. Increase only when interfaces/file ownership are genuinely independent; more agents reading the same whole repo increases context and integration churn.

Each dispatched task receives a short packet, not the conversation or every review:

1. Goal and packet ID, baseline/current integration revision, owned files/tests, non-goals.
2. Only relevant parity IDs and exact shared API definitions; source/test anchors for that slice.
3. Observable acceptance scenarios, platform authority and known issue disposition.
4. Restrictions: no production-profile use, install/publication, dependency/manifest/lockfile edits, mid-flight build/test/lint/format; request missing interface changes from integration owner.
5. Return contract: modified files, behavior implemented, contract changes requested, exact verification commands **not run**, blockers, and brief handoff. Never claim checks passed without execution.

Before dispatch, persist packet decisions and verified evidence in the repository's tracker; `bd` was unavailable in this environment and no `.beads` state was found, so no parallel tracking database or fake issue IDs were created. The implementation plan is not a second issue database. Use actual tracker IDs once the approved tool is available.

Keep common interface ownership narrow. Workers use nonoverlapping files or verified worktrees outside live app/model/profile paths. The parent owns integration and checks once a wave is complete. A worker can ask another owner a concrete API question, but cannot edit another owner's shared state. Prefer compact local handoff artifacts to repeatedly restating long results. Start a fresh bounded worker for the next packet rather than accumulating every subsystem in one agent.

For each integrated packet, one independent reviewer checks semantic/data/security boundaries; avoid redundant whole-repository reviews after every edit. Parent runs relevant tests and actual smoke, then records precise evidence and advances the tracker. At final integration, run the complete behavioral suite once plus native platform/installer gates. A failed gate returns to its owning packet with evidence, not a new competing architecture.

## 5. Verification and cutover rules

- **Behavioral oracle:** frozen synthetic fixtures derived from existing tests and authored corpus; compare intended behavior, not source text, UI wording, mock wiring or incidental implementation. Known bugs in review.md receive corrected expectations with explicit disposition.
- **Inference:** exact tokens/framing/grammar/sampler configuration where deterministic; safe mechanical outputs and actual model load/stream/cancel elsewhere. Do not demand identical probabilistic sentences or claim naturalness/latency parity from one generation. Large catalogue entries without available execution environments remain named open evidence gates, not silently deleted presets.
- **Mac native:** sign and launch the candidate normally via LaunchServices using existing identity; own-window controls first, then explicitly authorized host scenarios. Require model output -> actual same-line pixels -> Tab/full/repeated acceptance -> host readback, plus IME/secure/focus/Spaces/append-only/refusal cases. CLI-host authorization does not prove bundled-app TCC retention.
- **Windows/Linux native:** actual target runners/desktops with native compiler/dependencies. UIA rejection/IME/UIPI, X11 replay/conflicts and KWin manual transport are distinct gates; cross-compilation/source mocks are insufficient. Establish available target environments before claiming completion.
- **Data:** first synthetic profiles/keys; then only authorized backed-up profile migration. Compare settings/model/history identities and bytes where intended unchanged. Do not move the profile, regenerate an inaccessible key, reset consent/TCC, replace weights or delete user data to obtain a pass.
- **Updates/installers:** signed package provenance, actual external-data-preserving install/remove, healthy GUI ACK, failed/delayed-start rollback and clean worker/hook exit. Preserve quarantine and managed package boundaries. macOS notarization and Windows signing are independent release decisions.
- **Cutover:** keep the legacy baseline immutable as an external reference while developing the complete candidate. Final source/build/runtime entrypoints select Rust exclusively; migrate all callers and remove obsolete Python/PySide/PyObjC/PyInstaller production paths. Keep useful language-neutral fixtures/evidence, not permanent runtime adapters to old code.
- **Delivery:** exact source revision/artifact identity, features exercised, pass/skip/failure counts and real native evidence per platform. No normal-app replacement, public release, upload, signing-policy changes or held-platform publication follows implicitly from local conversion.

## 6. Current verification evidence and gates

| Boundary | Observed evidence | Limits / next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integrated Rust workspace | 451 passing invocations, including two child probes; native bins/examples and actual Tiny/Gemma worker/public CLI passed. Portuguese auto continuation, ready/proceed, stale-document refusal, release/reload and clean exit exercised. | Not a coverage comparison with Python. |
| macOS native CI | Complete tests/build/CLI/worker/twelve-pane settings/Welcome/EN-PT owned-preview acceptance/clean Quit/development bundle passed again in [41119387237](https://github.com/renan-brasilio/brotypist/actions/runs/41119387237), head `2f4f1f0` (14m40s). | Owned NSView captures are not external-screen, signed-host or live TCC proof. Authorized installation is recorded separately below. |
| Linux native CI | The same run passed the full Linux job (17m37s), including actual DEB install/replacement, owned X11/AT-SPI Quit, installed Tiny worker/public CLI, data-preserving purge and relocated portable diagnostics. The earlier inspected installer receipt explicitly records successful cleanup and `full_installer_matrix_passed=false`. | Previous-release upgrade and KWin manual transport remain unverified. |
| Windows native CI | Complete owned UI passed at `ad8e301`; [receipt](../../evidence/rust-migration/windows-owned-ui.json) and both inline captures inspected. Canonical `6b0a711` package passed PE/DLL closure, exact portable relocation/CLI/doctor, fresh MSI install, uninstall and unchanged synthetic data. Build-free [41136859854](https://github.com/renan-brasilio/brotypist/actions/runs/41136859854) replayed the same authenticated package in 51s with probe source `d07de3b`. | Native MSI reports exclusive per-user context 2/State 5/AssignmentType 0, but explicit HKLM 64-bit ARP metadata exists and HKCU ARP is absent. [Detailed evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/windows-installer-scope/windows-core-installer-smoke.json). Ownership gate remains closed; installed CLI/worker, repair and Quit were not reached. No scope/permission workaround; upgrade/rollback/publication remain held. |
| Signed Mac distribution | Candidate `a278b6b` matched the installed designated requirement. Actual DMG/ZIP extraction/copy, bundled CLI/Tiny inference, nonactivating launch, OS Quit/exit 0, removal/data-fixture preservation and ZIP traversal refusal passed. Receipt: `/private/tmp/brotypist-rust-source-a278b6b/installer-smoke/macos-installer-smoke.json`. | Receipt is explicitly `full_matrix=false`: no previous-version/OTA, notarization or physical-host typing claim. |
| Data/tool contracts | Synthetic AES-GCM and startup-ACK interoperability; relocated independent offline review CLI, source-hash/raw-output/private-file/no-overwrite behavior; authentic locked-source dependency notices passed. | Notices do not grant a first-party license. No app/model/profile access was needed by offline review. |
| Unicode | Shared allocation-free casefold matches all 1,112,064 valid scalars against immutable Python Unicode 15, correcting 129 dependency-table differences. Rules/history/choices/utilities/archive collision/MSI identity regressions passed. [Mapping proof](../../evidence/rust-migration/unicode15-casefold.json). | No normalization/category/regex equivalence claim. |

The full 51-case Gemma corpus matched every insertion/decoded-choice value and prompt-token count between Rust and immutable Python. Forty-eight raw strings were byte-identical; three differed only in alternatives JSON whitespace. Both retained the same three safe-empty availability failures (`language-en-locale-preference`, `grammar-fr-agreement`, `suffix-ja-unspaced`): **48/51 each**, not a full pass or semantic-quality approval. Reports: `/private/tmp/brotypist-rust-full-corpus-z95szwqa/report.json` and `/private/tmp/brotypist-oracle-full-corpus-iy2tsw_d/report.json`.

Six selected direct/worker benchmark cases passed mechanical checks. Separate direct EN/PT diagnostics exercised the 256-token cap, sampler/BOS/token budgets and process-lifetime RSS. Direct cancellation passed; one after-result worker cancellation was explicitly inconclusive because the producer had already finished. These are not physical-typing latency or universal stochastic-output claims.

Remaining acceptance boundaries: Windows installed runtime/repair/native Quit and registry-ownership diagnosis; signed external-host editing/readback and live TCC; actual KWin controls/refusal/input forwarding/cleanup; previous-release upgrades/rollback/OTA; unavailable large-model scenarios. No timeout, provider/model, ownership or paint-safety gate is relaxed to obtain a pass. Main and published releases remain unchanged.

## 7. Authorized local macOS installation

At the user's explicit request, signed Rust/AppKit candidate `22fb3fe2bd1472d1f5726897988fcbf0b998880f` was installed at `/Applications/BroTypist.app` using an atomic directory exchange. A private original-bundle and opaque-profile backup is retained. The exact designated requirement matches the former app; normal settings and history database remained byte-identical after completed nonactivating launch, and the selected model exists without replacing weights. Xcode 27.2 compiled the actual Icon Composer source and the canonical signed bundle; CI remains pinned to 27.1. The targeted tooling suites passed 57 invocations.

[Redacted installation evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-local-install.json) records the actual source, signature and process-health limits. CLI Accessibility diagnostics and the external AX observer were denied; those results do not establish the GUI process's live authority. No visual/inline-typing, notarization or OTA claim is made, and no permission grant/TCC reset was attempted. Main and published releases remain unchanged.

## 8. macOS menu and Settings regression correction

The user's installed-app screenshots exposed visual regressions not caught by prior owned-control assertions. The resident menu now contains only the six baseline action groups, with no battery view/percentage/charging cue or raw diagnostic/model header. Battery Settings, sampling and power policy remain. Settings restores the immutable AppKit baseline's grouped row geometry, full-width wrapped details and viewport-derived document sizing. Sidebar navigation clears the traffic lights, has an appearance-aware native selection background and scrolls independently of its bounded status footer. Retained editors and all destinations remain.

The [native layout receipt and images](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-ui-layout/receipt.json) exercise the actual Kit/Settings, twelve panes, General at 900×640 / 760×560 / 1000×740, light/dark appearance, and scrolling through the final General row and detail. The real native menu has eight rows including separators and no custom dashboard views. The integration owner inspected the rendered General, minimum/bottom, light-mode, Personalization and Battery images. Workspace tests passed **396 tests** (plus two nested child invocations). Foreground was unchanged and no profile directory was created by this capture.

Reproduce this bounded layout check with a new absolute output path:

```sh
cargo +1.99.1 run --locked -p brotypist --features native-smoke \
  --example native_desktop_smoke -- --layout-only /private/tmp/brotypist-new-layout
```

This mode never constructs a Controller, starts hooks/services, loads a profile, requests permissions or activates the app. Its native theme-frame bitmaps are not WindowServer vibrancy/compositor, signed-host typing or live TCC proof; the full activating desktop smoke remains CI-only.

The corrected signed app, source `61c4e36284b0c3da3c34b6a4c8b5576879413a75`, is now installed and running at `/Applications/BroTypist.app`. [Installation evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-ui-local-install.json) records strict signature/inventory verification, the unchanged designated requirement, graceful old-process exit, atomic exchange, a fresh private app/profile rollback backup, unchanged settings/history bytes and the existing selected model. LaunchServices completed background launch without taking foreground or exiting during the eight-second event observation. No model replacement, TCC reset, main merge or release publication occurred.

## 9. Bounded Windows installer diagnosis

`workflow_dispatch` accepts optional `installer_artifact_run`; an empty value preserves the complete native matrix. A nonempty same-repository run ID selects only the hosted Windows artifact-reuse job:

```sh
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref migration/rust-native \
  -f installer_artifact_run=41127270547
```

The probe authenticates the original Actions artifact digest and immutable run-head/PR-merge-parent binding, preserves its raw package receipt, verifies MSI/ZIP bytes and exact portable payload, then changes only artifact paths in a probe-only InputFile for the existing native lifecycle script. It records original package source separately from probe checkout/core/adapter identities; an associated PR's current head is not immutable run identity. Model acquisition stays checksum-pinned and inside private work, never the normal cache.

This is a diagnostic lane, not a completed installer matrix: the archive lacks `worker_smoke.exe`, so installed-worker execution is explicitly unexercised rather than invented. Normal canonical worker/upgrade/rollback/publication gates are unchanged. The current CLI credential cannot dispatch Actions (403); an explicitly scoped temporary Git trigger exercised the lane and was removed afterward. [Actual replay evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/windows-installer-scope/windows-installer-reuse.json) records verified artifact/package/model hashes and the still-failed native ownership gate, with successful install/uninstall/data preservation. It matches the external MSI/ARP behavior reported in [WiX #9323](https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/issues/9323); no Windows acceptance criterion is relaxed. Broad registry-debug scaffolding was removed after preserving the bounded explicit-view evidence.

## 10. Shared Settings alignment follow-up

The user's follow-up exposed remaining alignment drift: form headings/notes/rows/custom blocks used different leading offsets, header controls were forced to 27 points, and switches were still allocated 42 points while current AppKit reports an intrinsic 54×24. The shared form now uses one 38-point text inset, native content-alignment rectangles for control edges and centered header placement. Switches use the OS-reported size rather than a replacement constant. Compound status/action rows and slider endpoints resize within their actual allocation; the power card fits its actual parent.

The actual native switch-overflow assertion [failed before the factory correction](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-settings-alignment/switch-intrinsic-before.json) and [passed afterward](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-settings-alignment/receipt.json). The latter retains 25 images, native geometry for all twelve panes, minimum/expanded General/Setup/Personalization, reachable final General content, and four resize observations preserving the same Unicode instruction editor, text and UTF-16 selection. Shared leading/trailing edges, header centers, description separation and compound-child containment are checked from Cocoa-converted rectangles, not merely control presence. Workspace regressions passed 396 tests plus two nested child invocations.

Verification remained layout-only with no Controller, profile, hooks, downloads or permission prompts. The final capture left foreground unchanged. Native NSView/theme-frame images still do not prove WindowServer compositing or external-host typing. The full activating Mac shell smoke remains CI-only.

Signed source `b8d1bc11f5b2295571e391171708541578624331` was the alignment-only local installation, now superseded by the spacing follow-up below. Its [historical installation evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-settings-alignment-install.json) and private app/profile rollback remain retained.

## 11. Settings reading measure and spacing

The user's next screenshot rejected the remaining density, despite aligned edges. Shared rows now keep titles and descriptions in one bounded reading column, reserve separate control space and center controls against the complete text block. Vertical row padding, title/description spacing and heading/section gaps have a consistent rhythm. Narrow forms stack controls beneath the text; full-width editors, tables and action bars keep their allocation and identity.

Visual inspection also exposed clipped wrapping: an actual AppKit text-cell probe required three lines where attributed-string bounds and intrinsic sizing reported two. `text_height` now uses `NSCell.cellSize(forBounds:)`, the native minimum display-size API, rather than attributed-string bounds. The render probe checks actual text-cell height against retained row-label frames, plus text/control separation, text-block centering, row padding and section spacing. Heading-only sections still introduce custom content without an extra empty-group gap. Existing placeholder-width normalization is preserved, avoiding accidental group-wide stacking.

[Spacing evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-settings-spacing/receipt.json) passed with 41 native images and 63 geometry observations: twelve baseline panes; General/Setup/Models/Context/Personalization at minimum and expanded sizes; each representative pane's final content/control reachable at all three sizes; and the same Unicode editor/text/UTF-16 selection retained through four resize observations. Native General/Models/Context/narrow General, expanded Setup, final General controls and retained editor renders were inspected. All 396 workspace tests plus two nested child invocations passed. Final capture left foreground unchanged and never created its isolated profile directory. These remain native-view images, not WindowServer/TCC/external-host typing proof.

Signed spacing source `315d125c2a9bf36143af63208afd6c1ab585f864` is installed and running at `/Applications/BroTypist.app`. [Installation evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-settings-spacing-install.json) records exact candidate/installed inventory, preserved original signing requirement, graceful prior-app exit, a fresh locked opaque profile backup, atomic exchange, normal-profile Rust/AppKit doctor with selected model present and completed inactive startup. Settings and history bytes remained unchanged; foreground stayed unchanged. All previous rollback copies remain retained. Main and published releases are unchanged.

## 12. Sidebar selection craft and pending icon handoff

The user's Cotypist reference establishes the sidebar's visual acceptance: the selected row must contain its icon with visible inset padding, and the category icons need more visual weight. Rows now retain a full native button target while placing a larger tile inside a transparent padded image canvas. One opaque rounded `NSBox` supplies selection; native button-cell alternate/highlight fills are disabled without removing logical state or actions. A dynamic semantic fill is retained directly so switching from dark to light does not freeze the dark selection color. Actual selection movement, rather than only a native push-on/push-off button's already-changed state, drives emphasis and reveal; ordinary status refreshes do not force sidebar scrolling. Rule details keep App Settings selected.

[Sidebar evidence](../../evidence/rust-migration/macos-sidebar-craft/receipt.json) contains 43 native images and 67 geometry observations, including selected About in dark/light and narrow-height cases. The probe measures the actual image bitmap ink and native cell drawing rectangles: larger tiles, inset padding, title separation, one selection background and visible selected rows all passed. Images are retained through refreshes; all thirteen native destinations remain present. Native view images were visually inspected, workspace tests passed 396 plus two child invocations, foreground stayed unchanged and the isolated profile directory was never created. The probe now installs the production source-launch classic icon fallback, so About does not display a generic example-process icon. These are not compositor/external-host/TCC claims.

After the fourth rejected visual attempt, the user approved task-scoped reference use of [macos-design-guidelines](https://github.com/ehmo/platform-design-skills/tree/dc2be825d8b439caea78e9eaa8fb3ac23b0ff3e9/skills/macos), pinned at `dc2be825d8b439caea78e9eaa8fb3ac23b0ff3e9` (SKILL.md SHA-256 `9fa44a38eee0138d6aaf41b7f34223bcd9b25099e4706846b8773124fc5b6ecc`). Static review found MIT-licensed text/metadata with no bundled executable hooks. Only relevant sidebar/visual guidance is used; broad pack mandates do not expand the utility's scope. No persistent skill installation or behavior-quality guarantee is claimed.

The requested new app icon is **not integrated**: both the file reader and native unzip received `Operation not permitted` for `/Users/renanrocha/Downloads/brotypist-handoff.zip`; the requested accessible copy at `/Users/renanrocha/tmp/brotypist-handoff.zip` is absent. No permission bypass or substitute artwork. Obtain an attachment/accessibly copied ZIP before the combined signed update. The last verified installed source remains `315d125`; this sidebar source/render proof is not an installation claim.

Icon cutover must cover both `design/icons/BroTypist.icon` (modern macOS `Assets.car`) and committed `crates/brotypist/assets/app.icns` (classic/source-launch Mac), `app.ico` (Windows embedded and sidecar), `app-24.png`/`app-24@2x.png` (Linux runtime/Wayland), and all nine `assets/icons/app-{size}.png` desktop exports. Existing tooling compiles Composer and copies these exports; it does not regenerate the committed ICNS/ICO/PNG files. About/Welcome use the actual application icon. Category tiles, native monochrome Mac menu/accessory marks and text wordmark are separate, not arbitrary app-icon replacement targets.
