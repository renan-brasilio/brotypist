# Changelog

## Unreleased — native Rust migration

- Introduce a Rust application/worker with OS-native AppKit, Win32 and GTK interfaces, retaining the pinned llama.cpp engine and the complete existing model catalogue rather than substituting inference backends.
- Preserve configuration and OS identity, independent context/history consent, scalar-indexed authored text, encrypted SQLite formats and credential-store addressing. Keep a separately linked offline updater and Rust-native build/distribution tooling.
- Correct review findings in authority leases, decoded choices, pending spelling, consumed-key pairing, secure-input refusal and interrupted build promotion instead of preserving unsafe legacy behavior.
- Preserve transaction-first shortcut authority, non-browser Mac window context, visible completion acceptance during alternatives, and terminal append readback through stable session identity and one-use mutable evidence.
- Keep streaming inactivity timeouts separate from preparation deadlines, preserve the direct native benchmark's tokenizer/sampler/raw-stream/RSS diagnostics, and keep version changes compatible with locked Cargo builds. Include authentic, source-bound dependency notices without inventing a first-party license.
- Restore portable Models/Welcome and explicit-background settings navigation, retain diagnostic output when native initialization is unavailable, and preserve offline saved-output review labels in an independently linked Rust executable.
- Keep Windows model streams within one shared native CRT and bundle authenticated Visual Studio redistributables app-locally; reject undeclared CRT/OpenMP imports. Preserve owned preview writing when its language selector only gains or loses focus.
- Validate installed Linux diagnostics by structured readiness, paused state and absent doctor-created input hooks rather than obsolete status wording.
- Preserve the baseline's Unicode 15 full case folding across rules, history, choices, archive collision checks and installer identities, without rewriting authored text. Share one allocation-free iterator across the app, updater and tools.
- Support native Icon Composer packaging with verified Xcode 27.1 and 27.2, retaining the pinned CI toolchain and recording the actual compiler in bundle provenance.
- Complete the candidate source cutover: remove obsolete first-party Python runtime/tests, launchers, PyInstaller specification and build/tool dependency paths. Preserve the full immutable baseline externally and useful corpus/assets/evidence; no Python compatibility sidecar is shipped.
- Add native macOS/Windows/Linux CI, real model-worker probes, owned-window UI checks and guarded installer continuity probes. Published releases remain unchanged; an explicitly authorized signed local Mac candidate preserves the original bundle and profile.
- Place the Windows owned-preview caret explicitly at the UTF-16 seed end rather than only deselecting the old selection; retain bilingual caret/readback assertions and bounded failure metadata.
- Preserve canonical Windows build identity while using DOS drive-path spelling at the Cargo/CMake/MSBuild boundary and separate short private compiler scratch space. Retain failed diagnostics, owner-only staging, and real command-directory/permissions regressions without changing OS long-path policy.
- Resolve first-party notice manifests relative to Cargo's verified workspace spelling, preserving canonical identity and symlink/outside-root refusal across macOS aliases and Windows path namespaces.
- Separate MSI transaction observations from verified uninstall evidence, and adapt paths at WiX/MSI native boundaries while retaining artifact hashes, per-user ownership and data-preservation checks.
- Pass an explicit native-null current-user SID to MSI registration queries instead of PowerShell's empty-string coercion, retaining fail-closed status checks and bounded diagnostics.
- Avoid PowerShell's built-in `cli` alias when invoking actual portable/installed diagnostics and workers; retain the system alias table and bounded child-process checks.
- Allow the Windows Installer service to read produced MSI artifacts without broadening private profile/build-directory access or changing package bytes.
- Restore the compact macOS action menu; remove battery cards, percentages, charging decoration and verbose diagnostic/model dashboard rows from menu/status-item presentation while retaining Battery settings and power policy.
- Restore native grouped Settings rows, titlebar clearance, appearance-aware sidebar selection, bounded status text and viewport-based scrolling/resizing without replacing retained editors or dropping controls.
- Add a nonactivating, service-free native Settings layout capture mode for visual inspection; keep the full macOS desktop smoke CI-only.
- Add a build-free authenticated Windows installer artifact-reuse diagnostic lane, keeping original package source separate from probe checkout and preserving full canonical gates. Retain compact native-context/registry-presence evidence; do not relax the blocked per-user ARP ownership gate.
- Verification is tracked in `docs/rust-migration/`; historical Python receipts are not evidence of completed Rust/native parity.

## 0.4.13 — macOS Electron safety fixes

- Resolve delegated text geometry only through bounded, cycle-safe Accessibility traversal and an exact field-local UTF-16 mapping. Reject protected, hidden, nested-editable, ambiguous and unrelated descendants rather than guessing an inline anchor.
- Route completion insertion using exact chat bundle identities or Chromium node capabilities, not application-name substrings. Preserve modifier, permission, focus and stale-snapshot checks.
- Mark unreliable Electron/Chromium replacement controls as append-only. Ordinary completion and focused model preparation remain available; emoji replacement, synonyms and typo replacement are unavailable there rather than falsely reporting an edit.
- Extend native and runtime behavioral regressions for emoji, paragraphs, traversal limits, forbidden reads, host mutations and capability changes. Local verification: 1,524 passed / 22 skipped; an isolated real Gemma worker generated a continuation and exited cleanly. These checks do not establish live Discord rendering or Tab acceptance.
- macOS release candidate only until installer and real Discord verification pass. Linux and Windows packages remain held.

## 0.4.12 — Icon-only menu bar

- Remove battery percentages and power-state text from the macOS menu-bar item. Keep the BroTypist icon, compact menu, charging cue, Battery settings and accessible power details.
- Preserve user settings, selected models, native prediction behavior and clean Quit. The 0.4.11 tag remains unchanged; that release was not published.
- Rewrite the README around the app's purpose, implemented features, installation, privacy, development and contribution, without transient internal release/worktree details.
- Review all first-party code and build contracts. Add purpose headers, Python API docstrings, C ownership/ABI comments and explanations for non-obvious lifecycle, cancellation, privacy and rendering boundaries; preserve executable behavior and existing indentation conventions.
- Replace RAM-dependent default assertions and prompt-heading byte-count fixtures with saved-user-setting and required-writing preservation checks. Documentation verification passed 1,408 macOS tests (23 platform/session skips) and 1,556 Linux tests (21 platform skips).

## 0.4.11 — Unreleased, compact native menu

- Replace the macOS dashboard-style resident menu with six native action groups: global predictions, Pause, current-app predictions, Settings, Updates and Quit. Move model, power, recording and statistics detail out of the menu; existing Settings destinations remain available.
- Keep pause choices in a tracked submenu. Resume clears only the timed pause; a pause expiring while the menu is open cannot accidentally disable global predictions.
- Capture the app/domain targeted by a menu action before deferred execution. Preserve field controls, keyboard shortcuts, updater intent, draft handling and clean shutdown.
- This is a scoped macOS menu change. Linux development remains separate; no GitHub publication, Windows/Linux release or new prediction-quality claim.

## 0.4.10 — Unreleased, native visibility and learning QA remediation

- Apply the native ghost visibility/active-Space contract to explicit chooser presentation and cache reuse. Hidden, refused or other-Space choices acknowledge no insertion; unchanged presentations can recover without arming unseen words. Ordinary completion remains grey same-line text, not a popup fallback.
- Canonicalize only derived language/style evidence after slicing original authored ranges. NFC/NFD Brazilian Portuguese now yields equivalent learning while encrypted raw text and offsets stay unchanged; combining-mark boundaries cannot turn partial generated tokens into authored vocabulary.
- Add independent native glyph/baseline/clip/invalid-layout oracles, partial-visible-word acceptance and non-caret UTF-16/read-back boundaries, real bilingual clause-wrapper coverage, semantic learning-strength/accented-vocabulary assertions, actual native charging-help/dismissal and exact 19/20/21% presentation cases.
- Make statistics fixtures date-independent and synchronize the stale-spelling scenario on actual backend entry rather than elapsed sleep, with guaranteed worker cleanup.
- Verification: 1,391 passed / 22 skipped; new regressions fail against the old source at eleven intended chooser/Unicode assertions. All ten previously surviving meaningful faults and six new chooser/canonicalization/span faults are rejected. Actual owned native chooser hide/refusal/recovery and synthetic encrypted Unicode learning passed without changing foreground or user data. This selected fault set is not an overall mutation score.
- Source proof: `evidence/brotypist/qa-remediation-0.4.10.json`. macOS-only local work; no new Linux/Windows build, GitHub publication, model-quality guarantee or physical typing-latency claim.
- Accept legitimate macOS `Frameworks` → `Resources` asset-root symlinks by resolving the root before applying containment checks. The real-filesystem relocated-root positive fails before the correction; parent traversal, absolute outside paths, per-file outside symlinks and missing images remain rejected. This path-handling correction is separate from the initial observer failure: macOS MenuBarAgent exposes the actual status button with the owning app's PID.
- Fix native deferred Quit dispatched from the GUI timer: independently schedule cleanup in AppKit's documented modal termination mode, rather than waiting for the initiating timer to re-enter itself. Preserve pending-operation retries, menu tracking and draft-cancellation replies.
- Final source regression run including packaging and deferred-Quit follow-ups: 1,399 passed / 22 skipped in 24.55 seconds. All three new modal termination cases fail before the fix and pass with the independent shutdown continuation.


## 0.4.9 — Unreleased, inline capture and bilingual/power polish

- Fix short WhatsApp drafts rejected before inference when spell-check metadata split a word and its trailing space into separate attributed runs. Coalesce typography-equivalent ranges only; retain independent AX geometry, UTF-16 boundaries, real font/baseline/IME changes, suffix and focus/privacy guards. Ordinary suggestions remain grey same-line text, never a popup fallback.
- Revalidate cached native ghost visibility before acknowledging it: an identical completion is redrawn after hiding or moving off the active Space, and a temporary font-resolution failure can recover without changing the text. If native ordering cannot show the panel, report no visible insertion rather than arming unseen text.
- Preserve the full typed lexical ending as bounded, separately tokenized task data during healing. Guide Brazilian Portuguese/English code-switching by the current clause, avoid forced slang and keep explicit preferences ahead of uncertain language hints. Generation remains probabilistic: model abstention and unreliable explicit language overrides are documented, not hidden behind a grammar-quality claim.
- Use accessible native icon actions in app/model toolbars and short, interruptible pane-arrival fades. Keep semantic/destructive controls readable, existing unsaved-draft behavior, menu-bar presence, minimal field controls and Quit.
- Add asynchronous shared power sampling, live menu/Battery percentages, distinct charging/plugged-in/unknown/no-battery states and a bounded charging cue. Honor Reduce Motion, contrast and session/visibility changes without putting hardware sampling on the typing path.
- Ask for charging help once per known discharge at 20% or below, without taking keyboard focus or moving Spaces. Rearm only on verified external power; never prompt from missing/unknown capacity. Use native SDK session keys and recognize optimized-charge-hold reports where presence metadata directly follows “not charging.”
- This is macOS work only. Preserve saved models, local-learning consent, privacy switches, history, shortcuts and resident-model settings; new Linux/Windows builds remain held.
- Local signed 0.4.9 has composer-only real WhatsApp pixel proof after one word, including a normal-profile observation after normal relaunch, and a same-identity installation with unchanged external data. Verification remains bounded to its recorded source/artifacts; no new public release or physical typing/latency guarantee follows. See `evidence/VERIFICATION.md`.


## 0.4.8 — Unreleased, opt-in resident model

- Make an explicit idle timeout of `0` prepare the selected cached GGUF at startup, before any writing field is needed, and keep it loaded through inactivity. Preserve the five-minute default and every nonzero saved timeout; disclose the higher steady memory use in Battery settings.
- Use the existing configuration-only preparation protocol: no draft, references, custom instructions or learned writing enter startup preparation, and it generates no suggestion. Respect global pause/disable, battery on-demand and the selected installed battery model. Keep lifecycle/privacy release barriers and prepare fresh state after reactivation.
- Attempt resident preparation once per activation/model rather than silently retrying a failed load on each GUI tick. Keep short-input, insertion, native layout and context-safety behavior unchanged.


## 0.4.7 — Unreleased, early-input prediction

- Make automatic completion eligible after the first non-whitespace character by default, rather than requiring eight preceding characters. Keep the typing-pause, native layout, privacy, selection and stale-target guards; explicit higher saved thresholds are still respected.
- Wake obsolete optional-context preparation immediately when its request is superseded, cancelled or stopped. A newer draft no longer waits behind the old request’s unused context budget; the current request retains the same bounded fresh-context opportunity.
- Preserve the selected model, context budget, idle-release policy and configuration-only model preparation. These corrections do not promise instantaneous cold model loading or a suggestion for every prefix.


## 0.4.6 — Unreleased, macOS native design

- Give AI Models its own settings destination, with recommended/installed catalogue choices, explicit download/import and cancellation. Move backend/file/acceleration/prompt diagnostics behind Advanced; clarify the master prediction switch versus defaults for apps without rules.
- Select and acquire models directly in Welcome without opening Settings. A pending missing model cannot borrow another model’s readiness; recheck file and native inference-library readiness before Continue. Keep downloads and model use explicit, preserve license gates and never run a prediction just to select a model.
- Make settings genuinely resizable. Measure and reflow native text and controls while retaining unsaved instruction editors, selection, first responder and scroll position; size App Settings actions to their actual native titles instead of clipping them.
- Replace competing update buttons with one state-based action and progress card. Bind its displayed intent so a stale Cancel click cannot turn into Install; preserve confirmation, dirty-draft, shutdown and transactional-updater safety.
- Fix the first Setup badge refresh selecting Setup instead of the requested pane. Refresh only that row rather than rebuilding sidebar selection.
- Compile real light/dark/tinted Icon Composer resources before signing. Preserve Ghost Caret geometry and the classic compact fallback; modern macOS scales the full native artwork and can apply its own enclosure treatment. Do not promise size-specific modern geometry or macOS 15 appearance coverage.
- Correct public-repository and same-line preview copy. Ordinary completion remains grey inline text, not a popup fallback. Linux/Windows redesign builds, normal installation and publication are not part of this local macOS candidate.


## 0.4.5 — signed app updates

- Add credential-free OTA checks against publisher-signed public GitHub metadata, with pinned Ed25519 identity, native-platform package selection, streamed size/hash verification and cancellable downloads. Automatic checks are configurable and bounded to one attempt per day; download/install require explicit action.
- Add resident-menu and About update controls on macOS/Linux without expanding the minimal field menu or running downloads on the GUI thread.
- Bundle an independent offline updater that waits for successful resource shutdown and actual process exit, validates the complete native build and atomically exchanges directories. A verified native GUI startup acknowledgment completes installation; failure rolls back while retaining the previous build.
- Preserve models, encrypted history, preferences, startup identities and quarantined download provenance. Prevent unconfirmed update launches from starting inference; publish startup receipts atomically so readers cannot mistake incomplete files for failed startup.
- Respect managed Debian installs by handing the verified package to the system installer instead of silently replacing `/opt`; source/read-only/held installations cannot self-replace.
- Publish source/downloads without embedding a GitHub credential. Keep free Apple Development signing and document app-specific Open Anyway approval; no Developer ID, notarization, global Gatekeeper bypass or quarantine removal is claimed. Existing versions through 0.4.3 need one manual bootstrap installation. Windows and iCloud remain held.


## 0.4.3 — macOS and Linux

- Learn bounded local style and recurring vocabulary from newly observed authored edits under existing encrypted-history consent. Keep exact app/website and confident language matching, exclude BroTypist-generated edits and unproven existing drafts, and treat learned evidence as advisory data rather than instructions or model-weight training.
- Preserve recording defaults, scoped exclusions, strength and unaccepted-session consent. Deletion cancels prepared/in-flight suggestions, releases model context and clears derived state; locked history never unlocks implicitly.
- Prepare the trusted fixed policy prefix without generating text or evaluating drafts, preferences, references or learned writing. Reuse its native KV prefix; retain context, KV precision, saved idle lifetime and privacy gates.
- Fix Linux Quit blocked behind exported tray menus, inaccessible no-tray close loops and controller/native-keyboard shutdown lock inversion. Keep a visible Quit button in Settings and Welcome, preserve unsaved Save/Discard/Cancel, release owned hooks/workers and keep recovery controls on real cleanup errors.
- Interrupt an owned stalled model body read on cancellation, report smaller available chunks, preserve existing weights and remove partial files. Pending background cancellation unwinds asynchronously during Quit rather than requiring another click.
- Resume Linux builds from the latest shared core, with explicit model-license controls and native installer/Quit checks. Preserve desktop identities and KDE selection; ordinary KDE Wayland inline completion remains unavailable, with no unsafe preedit or popup substitute. Windows and iCloud remain held.

## 0.4.2 — macOS

- Prepare cached local weights in authorized multiline fields before ordinary prediction is due, including empty writable native fields with verified window identity/bounds. Use a configuration-only worker command; never evaluate writing during that preparation or relax same-line drawing/acceptance checks. Do not download/select a model automatically. Preserve saved idle release and battery force-only behavior.
- Reuse model allocations across prompt, length and context-budget changes that do not replace the backend/path/acceleration. Keep pause, privacy revocation and Quit release barriers, including newer preparation racing an older release and typing cancellation.
- Cache only bounded trusted framing token IDs, not drafts, references or writing preferences. Retain full-cache/prefix reuse rather than trade warm latency for an unproven compact-cache default.
- Refresh focused-window reference text for each prediction instead of trusting a geometry-only cache as a content revision. Await the new authorized background read for up to 250 ms; never reuse the previous reference on timeout. Clear retained OCR text too when screenshot context is opted in.
- Match relevant references with canonical Unicode keys and bounded links for unspaced scripts, without normalizing the user's inserted text. Keep reference data in the actual user task. Optional on-device language evidence is advisory, not a locale override or a grammar guarantee.
- Preserve lexical token healing for ordinary suffix/append requests; allow native EOS immediately after replay when no insertion is needed. Fix streamed decimal and CJK sentence boundaries.
- Bind browser suggestions to native window/document identity, reject unsafe ancestry and malformed/stale attributed runs, and stop visual clipping at the owning window rather than nonvisual application metadata.
- Validate the running Codex process against the exact signed 0.162.1 renderer identity rather than its installation pathname. Tighten native row/clip/attachment leases; retain the existing terminal, other-agent, multiplexer and Docs exclusions.
- Verify the separately signed, installed app in native WhatsApp/Telegram composers, including real Tab acceptance, changed visible reference facts, live permission badges and persistent menu-bar controls. These bounded checks do not establish complete Cotypist compatibility, human-calibrated multilingual quality, desktop latency or RAM parity. Linux/Windows builds and iCloud remain held.

## 0.4.1 — macOS

- Fix a macOS SIGTRAP while typing: AppKit/HIToolbox logical-key translation now runs on the main queue and publishes a cached key map to the background Quartz tap. Preserve layout-dependent shortcuts and physical Above-Tab behavior.
- Allow the one-point advance uncertainty of independently rounded integer AX edges; retain stricter fractional-coordinate checks and independent sub-span agreement. This prevents ordinary WhatsApp words from being silently rejected.
- Restore ordinary WhatsApp completion when UIKit advertises an empty visible-character range for non-empty text. Retain native glyph and ancestor clipping checks; reject explicitly hidden fields before reading their value.
- Measure the caret's visual row rather than rejecting soft-wrapped paragraphs. Account for one-point integral AX line-box rounding without accepting arbitrary baseline mismatches.
- Calibrate native font advances to the actual caret position, not padded AX glyph envelopes. This keeps one-character styling runs usable without relaxing field, clipping or stale-input guards.
- Support Qt/Telegram document ends whose zero-length caret bounds and font attributes are missing. Derive the insertion point from the observed final LTR glyph and fit a system drawing font; this is not an exact host-font claim and never displaces existing words.
- Keep screenshot options opt-in and off during messenger verification. Preserve the model, shortcut, consent and profile settings; no popup fallback or new model download.
- Expose keyboard input-source classification in `doctor` and fixed, content-free native failure diagnostics in Setup. Exception messages and writing are never included.

## 0.4.0 — macOS

- Keep Ghost Caret ordinary completion as verified same-line grey text, not an ordinary popup. Extend the native path without claiming universal input compatibility.
- Add independently sourced, revision/checksum-pinned Google Gemma 4 E2B and Gemma 3 writing support alongside the preserved Qwen option. Keep model acquisition/selection explicit; larger catalogue entries are not execution or quality proof.
- Generate explicit alternatives through the ordinary caret-conditioned native continuation/token-healing path: at most five samples, up to three distinct valid choices, excluding the current anchor. Return fewer choices or none rather than fabricate novelty; retain strict parsing, boundary and control/thought/tool guards.
- Align the synthetic benchmark with that zero-to-three alternatives contract. Report actual choice counts, empty results and safe absences separately from mechanical pass counts; leave semantic/grammar quality ungraded. Preserve the stricter selected-word synonym contract.
- Develop an explicit, document-bound Google Docs accessibility helper using metadata only when ordinary capture is unavailable; do not fabricate a writable snapshot, caret or success state.
- Add opt-in Terminal/iTerm Automation setup with per-host permission state. Bind the Terminal.app adapter to independent native window/session/process identity and the source-verified Codex 0.162.1 single-line composer; verify fixed-cell fonts against real pixels. Do not advertise other agents, iTerm input or multiplexers as working.
- Record the completed private deep REA investigation, bounded real Google-model samples and synthetic native typing observations with their source identities and limits. No proprietary recovered code/assets/weights enter the app, and Ghidra/Java are analysis tools, not product dependencies.
- Pause Linux/Windows product builds and publication. Preserve existing settings, cached Qwen weights, startup/data identity and strict input/privacy gates. The new Mac bundle and each release artifact require separate frozen/runtime verification; no universal compatibility, latency/RAM superiority or grammar-parity claim is made.
- Block Google Docs preference mutation through Aside Browser after live native actions disagreed with persisted preference state. Keep its metadata setup hint and explicit manual instructions rather than claiming success.
- Preserve the current lexical word when sampling partial-word alternatives, honor alternatives/anchor across the actual worker protocol, reject cross-line healing, and avoid active event-tap mouse-motion churn.

## 0.3.3 — Unreleased

- Separate the field accessory's minimal current-app, temporary pause/resume and Settings menu from the menu-bar dashboard. Keep Quit in the menu bar.
- Capture the app/domain before menu tracking so a deferred toggle cannot affect the settings app or a newly focused window.
- Report unsupported ordinary completion as unavailable here, not Active, without disabling the user's global preference.
- Add logical-size compact Retina artwork and explicit 1×/2× native field-glyph representations. Keep full-size I-beam/two-pill artwork separate from the compact one-pill variant.
- Hide the native accessory when it cannot fit above the writing line instead of moving it beside or over text.
- Repeat the Cotypist REA reference pass and confirm Gemma 4 E2B is selected/recommended in the original UI. Document the current Qwen-specific guided prompt as a migration constraint; do not silently change models or claim unmeasured Gemma performance.

## 0.3.2 — Unreleased

- Rename the public app, CLI, installers and private GitHub repository to BroTypist / `brotypist`. Keep established bundle, startup, credential-store and data identifiers so the visual rebrand does not reset settings, model caches, encrypted history or permission identity.
- Use the supplied Ghost Caret SVG artwork directly, including the thicker simplified small-size icon. Rasterize without added enclosure lighting/bevels; remove obsolete Composer exports and keep macOS generation Qt-free.
- Reorganize native AppKit and portable Qt preferences into General, AI Models, Autocomplete, Languages, Privacy and About, retaining the existing supported settings and configured defaults.
- Add six-step Welcome with actual OS-access status, explicit existing model management, truthful privacy disclosures and an ephemeral real-model try-it field. Reuse the current provider and acceptance rules; do not record preview text or retain a second preview worker after leaving the field.
- Replace ordinary suggestion chips with verified host-font, baseline-aligned, transparent grey inline text. Require safe native typography, line-end insertion, visible clipping and no composition/selection; unsupported inputs stay silent without consuming acceptance keys. Keep explicit alternatives separate.
- Keep source/release links private-access aware and preserve historical Inklow release assets and research evidence. This redesign does not add MLX, Sparkle, new models, new language-quality guarantees or changed acceptance keys.
- Add bounded, opt-in focused-window Accessibility context with protected/hidden-node pruning, exact field/window checks, relevance/deduplication, provenance and prompt budgets. Prefer the focused browser document over deeply nested browser chrome. Remove unsafe screenshot/OCR capture and its unused frameworks.
- Separate newest-only context collection from prediction preparation; revalidate policy before sensitive reads and discard revoked/stale results. Expose fixed content-free context and inline capability diagnostics.
- Default to 150 ms typing delay and five-minute model retention, preserving saved values. Dispatch prepared requests and streamed results onto the UI thread immediately; keep bounded fallback capture and result polling.
- Marshal Qt clipboard reads to the GUI thread with a bounded wait and fresh authorization; cancelled/timed-out queued reads cannot later access the clipboard.
- Fix native macOS baseline offset interpretation and reject subpixel-clipped invisible suggestions before acceptance.

- Add a native KWin input-method-v1 client over the compositor-provided private socket, prepared before Qt starts. Keep ordinary X11 operation separate; do not impersonate a screen reader or use raw-device/global input injection.
- Retain compositor-positioned brand and keyboard-navigable manual-menu surfaces with reusable buffers. Remove the new native preedit ABI after real KWin/Qt selection-loss and missing-style failures; Wayland ordinary completion is explicitly unavailable, not a popup fallback.
- Corroborate native surrounding text with privacy-gated AT-SPI metadata and exact current text/caret before insertion. Separate stable field/context identity from changing revision tokens; retain word-by-word acceptance while rejecting stale snapshots, selections, protected fields, and changed focus.
- Confirm the resulting target text before reporting an insertion as accepted. Keep atomic replacement, selected-text synonyms, and emoji rewriting disabled on Linux.
- Add explicit per-user input-method registration and a native KDE selector link without selecting the method, altering the desktop session, or selecting/downloading a model automatically. Document the tested text-input-v3 path and unsupported/incomplete protocol contexts; published 0.3.0 installers remain unchanged.
- Bootstrap missing KWin context state asynchronously, first establishing purpose and then safe surrounding state. Bound resynchronization to those initial phases, guard each reply against context changes, and do not alter input-method selection, visibility mode, protected-field policy, or native snapshot validation.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-24

- Keep model-download progress and verified model availability updating even when the parent Settings window is hidden or input/menu polling is paused. The Models dialog owns its refresh timer and stops it while hidden.
- Preserve model-dropdown selection/popups by avoiding inventory rebuilds when nothing changed. Existing downloaded weights are reused; no model migration, default change, or redownload is required for this UI fix.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-24

- Replace the editor with a menu-first agent: native AppKit preferences/overlays on macOS, native-themed Qt tray/preferences on Windows/Linux. Remove obsolete editor and in-process UI worker APIs; omit Qt from the Mac dependency/bundle.
- Add eleven native preference panes, explicit setup/permission links, compact General settings with expandable model management, configurable physical-key shortcuts, per-app/domain rules, custom-instruction Save/Revert, battery controls, and actual accepted-writing statistics.
- Move inference into a lazy, bounded stdio worker. Release the process after idle, pause, model change, and quit; preserve newest work during a same-model cold load. Document cold-load latency instead of promising instant predictions.
- Add opt-in OS-keychain-backed AES-GCM history, bounded vocabulary personalization, explicit deletion, and optional clipboard/scoped-window OCR context. Keep default recording/context off and disclose app recording overrides.
- Add offline Unicode 17 emoji/emoticon choices, skin/gender variants, contextual selected-word synonyms and alternative continuations. Improve utility prompts using actual failing/working local-model samples; do not invent dictionary fallbacks.
- Revalidate Windows UIA focus/protection before selection replacement, respect app/domain Tab precedence without disabling non-Tab shortcuts, preserve emoji precedence over pause alternatives, and fix macOS zero-length AX range row geometry using adjacent observed glyph bounds.
- Preserve REA-authenticated native reference evidence privately where preferences could contain personal text; publish sanitized records and real synthetic native UI/typing screenshots. Extend frozen-runtime verification to the actual isolated worker protocol.
- Fix a portable-settings field/method name collision found by Windows/Linux CI; exercise the actual Qt preferences and saved settings in an isolated offscreen smoke before retrying hosted verification.
- Make the portable settings smoke quit through Inklow's real application action, retaining the no-tray close-confirmation safeguard; bound the GUI smoke step so an unexpected dialog cannot stall the packaging pipeline.
- Build Windows/Linux x86 inference libraries with an explicit AVX2 baseline instead of cached host-native instructions; exercise the actual source worker before freezing as well as the packaged worker.
- Gate native model initialization before the next blocking stdin read, confirm request freshness after model readiness, send cancellation once per request, and cleanly retry failed warmups without retaining a broken model.
- Anchor a muted Inklow menu badge to supported field bounds even before typing. Use a field-attached suggestion card when native caret bounds are unavailable, while preserving exact focus/protection/snapshot checks and inline rendering when a caret is observable.
- Request only advertised per-app Electron/Chromium accessibility support, accept authoritative focused-element metadata when its redundant focus flag is absent, and revalidate native focus/protection around context reads.
- Consolidate the development Mac installation into `/Applications/Inklow.app`, remove the owned versioned preview, preserve saved data, and show missing app-process permissions explicitly rather than implying an idle agent is ready.
- Make the floating control icon-only and place it above text, using nonoverlapping screen-edge placement. Keep menus stable across native timer ticks, suspend shortcut interception during tracking, and defer actions until fresh focus can be checked.
- Retain a fixed-size visible status/tray item while open, preserve menu-agent lifetime when preferences close, and verify the quick-menu Quit path. Document third-party menu-manager visibility policy separately from application registration.
- Support an optional existing Apple code-signing identity for executables, libraries and the final Mac bundle instead of discarding it in the final resource-sealing step.
- Add native release packaging: a per-user Windows MSI with both application EXEs, a Linux Debian package with desktop/icons integration, and an Apple Silicon macOS DMG with drag-to-Applications layout. Include complete portable archives and SHA-256 checksums; keep installed application names unversioned. Windows installer publication remains deferred pending native runtime verification.
- Collect Linux AT-SPI/GI bindings, typelibs and native libraries into the frozen payload instead of relying on developer Python packages at runtime. Derive Debian shared-library dependencies from the actual ELF payload.
- Gate automatic release publication on all three native builds, real local inference, installer launch/removal and external-user-data preservation checks. Self-hosted manual publication requires an explicit target set and identifies unpublished targets instead of silently dropping failed platforms. Record the exact source revision and native receipts; publish from a draft only after the selected artifacts are present and verified.
- Rewrite the README around installation, first-run permissions/models, privacy, platform requirements, development, native builds and the versioned release workflow. Explicitly disclose unsigned/not-notarized distributions and unfinished multilingual prediction work.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-23

- Preload/warm up inference outside the UI thread, use available GPU offload, stream completed words, cancel obsolete work, and reuse matching typed-through suggestions. Keep snapshot/privacy guards on every update and acceptance.
- Recommend a checksum-pinned Qwen2.5 1.5B guided writing model instead of the 135M English starter; add a cancellable model manager, installed-model selection, explicit CPU/auto acceleration, and direct/guided prompt profiles.
- Add original application and active/paused tray icons, native menus, timed pause, Show/Hide, global-mode control, settings/exclusions, diagnostics, About, and explicit guarded Quit.
- Support resident close-to-tray with no-tray fallback, UTF-8 Open/Save/Save As with atomic writes, and unsaved-change protection. Keep a new untouched editor clean and allow final visible-window closure after workers stop, so native Quit completes safely.
- Build native macOS/Windows/Linux applications with bundled runtime and icons, separate Windows console CLI, and Linux desktop integration. Exclude models/settings; protect replacement with an ownership marker and rollback; finalize macOS signatures after adding resources.
- Extend three-OS CI to native builds and frozen-runtime real inference. Preserve synthetic English/Portuguese outputs, measured latency, actual resident UI screenshots, and explicit model-quality limitations.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-23

- Add an independent cross-platform Qt predictive-writing editor with real local inference, word/full acceptance, dismissal, undo, and IME/focus safeguards.
- Add local GGUF, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible continuation backends; refuse remote/proxied/redirected inference routes.
- Add verified, immutable-revision starter-model acquisition without committing weights.
- Add opt-in macOS AX/Quartz, Windows UIA/native input, and Linux AT-SPI/X11 integration with protected-field and stale-snapshot checks.
- Use UTF-8 byte lengths for AT-SPI insertion while preserving character-based caret offsets.
- Normalize generated tabs to spaces so accepted predictions cannot navigate forms.
- Install native Qt libraries in headless Linux CI and exercise a real offscreen desktop launch on every OS.
